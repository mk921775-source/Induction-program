Unexpectedly, Dr. H.S. Rai sought 10 students to work with him â€“ not for him. I felt it was divine intervention when I got selected to be part of this group, which eventually grew to 50 members. From the second day of college, we began learning the latest technologies, an opportunity rarely seen elsewhere.
